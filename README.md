# Employee API Service

### Background
This is a repo to exercise some Spring framework stuff. 

### Useful Stuff

#### Rest Controller
- The controller pulls data from an RDS MySQL DB, the setup scripts can be found in the resources section. 
- There is also Spring Rest Data enabled, which means all the endpoints using the entity names are active. 
- The Employee entity being available means that the endpoint at /employees is automatically created, with all the HATEOAS stuff that goes with it.

#### Repositories
- The extension of the JpaRepository allows for all the DAO stuff to be automatically available, so using repository.save(), 
repository.findAll() etc for each of the CRUD functions.

#### Caching
- @EnableCaching on the Main application sets the capability, then @Cacheable on a method means caching is available for
that method and @CacheEvict means it'll be cleared when the method is triggered.

#### Actuator
- /health and /info metrics are available through the /actuator endpoint.

#### AOP
- Aspects are set up to trigger when cache is evicted. 
- The pattern can be copied for other annotations, or set via 'execution(* *.methodName(..))' to allow for any params to be passed to a method of method name in any package and with any return type.
